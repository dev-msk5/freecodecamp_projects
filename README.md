My coding projects from freeCodeCamp

Notes:

Dear reader,

Let me be honest: these projects didn’t actually take 300 hours to complete. In reality, I spent around 60–70 hours coding, plus another 10–15 hours of "tutorial hell" and reading documentation. This was mainly because I started with a basic
to intermediate understanding of Python.

That said, I still learned a lot more than I expected, especially about modules and object-oriented programming (OOP). These concepts truly revealed how powerful and flexible Python can be.

While FreeCodeCamp’s course may not be an official academic certification, I’d genuinely recommend it to anyone looking to build a solid foundation in Python, especially through hands-on projects.


Thank you for keeping these in mind, have a nice day!
